# Abstract
In todayâ€™s landscape, where data is increasingly important for business success and where the crisis caused by COVID-19 has accelerated the process of digital transformation of companies in a dizzying way, cybercriminals are rubbing their hands together due to the exponential growth of opportunities to exfiltrate corporate information, steal intellectual property, extort, sabotage, etc.

Different technologies that act reactively, IDS, IPS, firewalls, and many others are used around the clock to deal with cyberattacks. However, proactive tools are needed to really understand why a cybercriminal is undertaking a cyberattack or to anticipate his movements.

The project presented in this report implements the prototype of an infrastructure capable of generating information for a security analyst to create intelligence on cyber threats gathered in cyberspace. In this way, decision-makers in different companies or organisations will be able to anticipate possible cyber-attacks that could compromise their business assets. 

For this purpose, the basis of T-Pot, a Linux distribution prepared by Deutsche Telekom to run multiple tools and honeypots, and Elastic Stack, a set of open-source tools that allows collecting data from any type of source and in any format to perform searches, have been modified. In addition to other current tools such as Nginx, Ansible, or Docker.

Finally, with the help of this prototype, two use cases will be shown, designing active defence campaigns, from which interesting conclusions can be drawn from the results obtained.
